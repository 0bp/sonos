When working with Queues and Playlists you will often be dealing with instances of the Track class.  
These are very basic objects with public properties:

~~~php
 # Get the name of the song
 echo $track->title;

 # The performing artist
 echo $track->artist;

 # The album it is from
 echo $track->album;

 # It's position on that album
 echo $track->number;

 # The album art (if available)
 echo "<img src='{$track->albumArt}'>";
~~~


They can be used with the addTrack(s) methods:

~~~php
 # Simple string version
 $queue->addTrack("x-file-cifs://LEMIEUX/music/dgm/frame/01-Hereafter.mp3");

 # Using a track object
 $track = new Track("x-file-cifs://LEMIEUX/music/dgm/frame/01-Hereafter.mp3")
 $queue->addTrack($track);
~~~


If you want to pass a custom object to addTrack(s) then your class must implement the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/api/classes/duncan3dc.Sonos.Tracks.UriInterface.html'>UriInterface</a>:

~~~php
 class Cifs implements \duncan3dc\Sonos\Tracks\UriInterface
 {
     public $file;
     public funcion __construct($file)
     {
         $this->file = $file;
     }
     public function getUri()
     {
         return "x-file-cifs://LEMIEUX/music/{$this->file}";
     }
 }
 $tracks = [];
 $tracks[] = new Cifs("blitz kids/the good youth/09-Pinnacle.mp3");
 $tracks[] = new Cifs("afi/crash love/03-End transmission.mp3");
 $playlist->addTracks($tracks);
~~~


## State Details

When getting state details from a controller the result is similar to the track class.  
All of the public properties at the top of this page are available, as well as:

~~~php
 $state = $controller->getStateDetails();

 # The same as $track->number, but with a more appropriate name
 echo $state->trackNumber;

 # If a stream is currently being played, then the string reported by the stream (otherwise null)
 echo $state->stream;

 # The current (zero-based) position in the controllers queue
 echo $state->queueNumber;

 # The duration of the currently active track (hh:mm:ss)
 echo $state->duration;

 # The position of the currently active track (hh:mm:ss)
 echo $state->position;
