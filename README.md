PHP classes to control Sonos speakers

Inspired by [DjMomo/sonos](https://github.com/DjMomo/sonos) and [phil-lavin/sonos](https://github.com/phil-lavin/sonos)


Classes
-------
Three classes are available:
* Network - Provides static methods to locate speakers/controllers on the current network
* Speaker - Provides an interface to individual speakers that is mostly read-only, although the volume can be set using this class
* Controller - Allows interaction with the groups of speakers. Although sometimes a Controller is synonymous with a Speaker, when speakers are grouped together only the coordinator can receive events (play/pause/etc)


Network Class
-------------
Public static properties
* $cache: boolean - Setting this to true will cache the expensive multicast discover to find sonos devices on the network  
Public static methods
* getSpeakers(): array - Returns an array of Speaker instances for all speakers on the network
* getSpeakersByRoom(string $room): array - Returns an array of Speaker instances for all speakers with the specified room name
* getSpeakerByRoom(string $room): Speaker - Returns a Speaker instance for the first speaker with the specified room name
* getControllers(): array - Returns an array of Controller instances, one instance per group of speakers
* getControllerByRoom(string $room): Controller - Returns a Controller instance for the speaker assigned as coordinator of the specified room name


Speaker Class
-------------
All of these properties are public
* ip: string - The IP address of the speaker
* name: string - The "Friendly" name reported by the speaker
* room: string - The room name assigned to this speaker  
There are also the folllwing public methods
* isCoordinator(): boolean - Returns true if this speaker is the coordinator of it's current group
* getVolume(): int - Get the current volume of this speaker as an integer between 0 and 100
* setVolume(int $volume): null - Set the current volume of this speaker
* adjustVolme(int $adjust): null - Adjust the volume of this speaker by a relative amount between -100 and 100


Controller Class
----------------
The Controller class extends the Speaker class, so all the public properties/methods listed above are available, in addition to the following public methods
* getState(): int - Returns the current state of the group of speakers using the Controller class constants:  
STATE_STOPPED  
STATE_PLAYING  
STATE_PAUSED  
STATE_TRANSITIONING  
STATE_UNKNOWN  
* getStateName(): string - Returns the current state of the group of speakers as the string reported by sonos: PLAYING, PAUSED_PLAYBACK, etc
* getStateDetails(): array - Returns an array of attributes about the currently active track in the queue
* play(): null - Start playing the active music for this group
* pause(): null - Pause the group
* next(): null - Skip to the next track in the current queue
* previous(): null - Skip back to the previous track in the current queue
* getSpeakers(): array - Returns an array of Speaker instances that are in the group of this Controller
* addSpeaker(Speaker $speaker): null - Adds the specified speaker to the group of this Controller
* removeSpeaker(Speaker $speaker): null - Removes the specified speaker from the group of this Controller
* setVolume(int $volume): null - Set the current volume of all the speakers controlled by this Controller
* adjustVolme(int $adjust): null - Adjust the volume of all the speakers controlled by this Controller by a relative amount between -100 and 100
* getMode(): array - Get the current play mode settings, the array contains 2 boolean elements (shuffle & repeat)
* setMode(array $options): null - Set the current play mode settings, using the array returned by getMode()
* getRepeat(): boolean - Check if repeat is currently active
* setRepeat(boolean $repeat): null - Turn repeat mode on or off
* getShuffle(): boolean - Check if shuffle is currently active
* setShuffle(boolean $shuffle): null - Turn shuffle mode on or off
* getQueue([int $start, int $limit]): array - Get details of the queue


Examples
--------

The classes use a namespace of duncan3dc\Sonos
```php
use duncan3dc\Sonos;
```

It is advisable to switch cache on to speed up the initial network lookup, be aware that you will need to clear this if you add/remove sonos devices from your network
```php
Network::$cache = true;
```

Get all the speakers on the network
```php
$speakers = Sonos\Network::getSpeakers();
foreach($speakers as $speaker) {
    echo $speaker->ip . "\n";
    echo "\t" . $speaker->name . " (" . $speaker->room . ")\n";
}
```

Start all groups playing music
```php
$controllers = Sonos\Network::getControllers();
foreach($controllers as $controller) {
    echo $controller->name . " (" . $controller->room . ")\n";
    echo "\tState: " . $controller->getState() . "\n";
    $controller->play();
}
```

Control what is currently playing in the Living Room, even if it is not the coordinator of it's current group
```php
$controller = Sonos\Network::getControllerByRoom("Living Room");
echo $controller->room . "\n";
$controller->pause();
```
