The `ControllerState` class can be used to store the current state of a controller.

_It is serializable via the standard php function to allow it to be stashed somewhere._

An instance should be created from the `Controller` object:

```php
$state = $controller->exportState();
```


If you intend to export the state and stop playback,
then to avoid a gap between when the state is captured and playback is stopped you can have the `exportState()` method stop playback:

```php
# Export state and pause the controller
$state = $controller->exportState(true);
```


After exporting the state, you can apply it to any `Controller` instance like so:

```php
$controller->restoreState($state);
```
