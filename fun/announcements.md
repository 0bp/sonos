The Sonos library supports making announcements via [text to speech](../text-to-speech/) functionality.

First you need to have a [SMB](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) share available, then you can setup a `Directory` instance using [Flysystem](//flysystem.thephpleague.com/).

~~~php
use duncan3dc\Sonos\Directory;

# The flysystem instance used to store temporary audio files for Sonos to retrieve
$adapter = new \League\Flysystem\Adapter\Local("/var/shares/sonos");
$filesystem = new \League\Flysystem\Filesystem($adapter);

# The SMB server (this must be in uppercase, and using an IP has been reported not to work)
$hostname = "LEMIEUX";

# The share name that is setup for the filesystem path defined above (/var/shares/sonos)
$smb = "{$hostname}/sonos",

# The final argument is the name of the directory that this object is for
$directory = new Directory($filesystem, $smb, "tts");
~~~


Once you have a `Directory` instance, you can then create audio messages using text to speech:

~~~php
use duncan3dc\Sonos\Tracks\TextToSpeech;

$track = new TextToSpeech("Testing, testing, 123", $directory);
~~~


You can use these just like any other [track](../../usage/tracks/), however the most interesting thing to do is interrupt the current activity with a message, and then resume playing again.

~~~php
$bedroom = $sonos->getControllerByRoom("Bedroom");

$bedroom->interrupt($track);
~~~


This will backup the current state of the controller (queue contents, stream details, volume, equalisation, etc), play the passed `$track`, and then restore the previous state, effectively interrupting the music to make an announcement and then carrying on where the music left off.
