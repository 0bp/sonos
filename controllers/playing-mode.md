Details about what is playing is available via a State object, this can be retrieved and used like so:

```php
$track = $controller->getStateDetails();

echo "Now Playing: {$track->title} from {$track->album} by {$track->artist}\n";
echo "Running Time: {$track->position} / {$track->duration}\n";
```


If you are not playing tracks but are streaming then the State object should be used a little differently:

```php
$state = $controller->getStateDetails();

if ($state->stream) {
    echo "Currently Streaming: {$state->stream}\n";

    # Most streams do not provide extra information, so check before using
    if ($state->artist) {
        echo "Artist: {$state->artist}\n";
    }
}
```

## Every day I'm shufflin'

In addition to what is currently playing, you can also control how it is playing:

```php
if (!$controller->getShuffle()) {
    $controller->setShuffle(true);
}
```

```php
if ($controller->getRepeat()) {
    $controller->setRepeat(false);
}
```

```php
if ($controller->getCrossfade()) {
    $controller->setCrossfade(false);
}
```
