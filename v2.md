Version 2.0 contains many breaking changes to make the library more robust and allowing you to safely hack together new features.  
The main change is that everything has an interface now, meaning you can swap out any class for a version of your own.  

* Tracks no longer have public properties, their attributes must be accessed using [getters](../api-v2/classes/duncan3dc.Sonos.Interfaces.TrackInterface.html).
* Speakers/Controllers no longer have public properties, their attributes must be accessed using [getIp(), getName(), and getRoom()](../api-v2/classes/duncan3dc.Sonos.Interfaces.SpeakerInterface.html).
* `Stream::getName()` has been replaced with `Stream::getTitle()`.
* `Network::getRadioStations()` and `Network::getRadioShows()` methods have been replaced with `Network::getRadio()->getFavouriteShows()` and `Network::getRadio()->getFavouriteStations()` respectively.
* All methods that deal with times (track duration/position, alarm schedule, etc) now accept/return [Time](../api-v2/classes/duncan3dc.Sonos.Utils.Time.html) instances, to avoid confusion over when to pass an integer, or a string, and whether seconds should be included or not.
* Methods that look for items on the network but don't find them not throw a `NotFoundException` instead of returning null, this makes it much clearer what the error is.


## Network Constructor

The biggest change is how you instantiate a `Network` instance.

<p class="message-info">For most common usage, nothing has changed, you still do: `new Network` and everything else is taken care of</p>

The `Network` constructor no longer accepts a cache or logger instance, just a [CollectionInterface](../api-v2/classes/duncan3dc.Sonos.Interfaces.Devices.CollectionInterface.html).  

If you want to use logging then your logger can be injected using `Network::setLogger()`.  

The cache is now managed by a [CachedCollection](../api-v2/classes/duncan3dc.Sonos.Devices.CachedCollection.html) and a Device [Factory](../api-v2/classes/duncan3dc.Sonos.Devices.Factory.html).  
By default all Devices will use an array based cache, so it will only persist for the duration of the current php execution.
And the standard Collection class does not cache at all, this is to avoid many bugs that were seen with frequently changing groupings, etc.
